/*
  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the column `createdAt` on the `Student` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `deletedAt` on the `Student` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `updatedAt` on the `Student` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[userId]` on the table `Student` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Added the required column `name` to the `User` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Changed the type of `role` on the `User` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
